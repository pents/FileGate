# FileGate

FileGate is an "simple" solution to share files from one computer to another

## NOTE

This is still WIP and depending on my free-time I will complete it sooner or later

## Usage

Download a client and start:

```bash

./FileGate.Client -p {path-to-sharing-folder}
```

After that you should be able to request a list of files in sharing folder and download them
